Objectives: Explore the effects of COVID-19 in the San Francisco County.
1) How do Covid-19 cases compare in different districts?
2) What might be a cause of different Covid-19 cases, despite having similar population sizes?
3) What do vaccination rates look like among different ethnic groups? 


All of the work was done using PgAdmin 4 (PostgreSQL), Tableau, and R (bookdown).
