[["index.html", "COVID-19 In San Francisco ", " COVID-19 In San Francisco Chris Tsang 2023-09-18 The COVID-19 pandemic left a lasting impact on many people throughout the United States. Being a native of San Francisco, I was compelled to delve into its effects in various neighborhoods of this city that I call home. I began my research by examining the COVID-19 positive case data of San Francisco residents, grouped by specific datetimes. However, I was quickly overwhelmed by the amount of information. To manage this, I decided to focus my analysis on comparing districts in San Francisco where I spent most of time growing up. At first glance, the total number of reported cases in each district looks similar. Across all districts there is a noticeable upward trend in the cases reported. For example, every district experienced a large spike in cases by January 2022. Both Chinatown and Lakeshore districts, which have about the same estimated populations, show a consistent rise in cases every quarter. This rise either begins to level off or increases at a slower pace as time goes on. But, by July 2023, Chinatown has about 400 more documented COVID-19 cases than Lakeshore. Having similar populations, could the size of the district affect the number of cases? From the image above, Chinatown and Lakeshore differ significantly in terms of size. Having a much more densely populated area could explain Chinatownâ€™s higher number of positive cases. However, when comparing Lakeshore with the Portola, Mission and Excelsior districts (all of which have relatively similar sizes) it is clear that Lakeshore has a distinctly lower case ratio than the others. This suggests that there might not be a correlation between the size of a district and the number of positive cases. Lastly, I shifted my attention to the vaccinations across different ethnic groups. By the end of 2023, White residents had the greatest administration of booster shots in all booster types. Also, the bivalent booster was preferred over the second monovalent among all ethnic groups, a trend possibly influenced by research and media coverage highlighting its greater effectiveness.
